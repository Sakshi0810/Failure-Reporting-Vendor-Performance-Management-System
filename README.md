# Failure-Reporting-Vendor-Performance-Management-System

This srs takes a pedagogical stance in demonstrating how results from theoretical computer science may be applied to yield significant insight into the behavior of the devices computer systems engineering practice seeks to put in place, and that this is immediately attainable with the present state of the art.

The focus for this detailed study is provided by the type of failure and vendor management systems currently being deployed throughout indian railways. Failure and system reliability concerns dominate in this domain. With such motivation, two issues are to be tackled: the s problem of keeping the records of different failure occurring in different  departments regularly and also to improve the vendor management and record keeping system . In the former case, the analysis is directed towards proving failure properties of the equipment  which are being used by different division of the railway on daily basis.Software also help in keeping the records of different vendors to be used in future for  providing better quality equipment to different sheds,deport and workshops of Indian railway.
